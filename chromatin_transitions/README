README for scripts to reproduce chromatin transition analysis, which shows the average transitions from the samples in the "A" file to the "B" file.

Pre-requisite: the ChromHMM input has to be segmented into 200bp windows. Example code to do this:

	# step 1 - download a hg19 chromosome size file
	wget https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools/blob/master/genomes/human.hg19.genome
	# step 2 - create a bed file of 200bp windows
	bedtools makewindows -g hg19.genome -w 200 > hg19.200.bed
	# intersect the 12 state chromatin segmentation for a sample with the 200bp segmented genome, creating a per 200bp state annotation
	intersectBed -a MySample_ChromHMM_12_state_segmentaion.bed -b hg19.200.bed |  > MySample_ChromHMM_12_state_segmentaion.200bp.bed
	# extract only the state column per 200bp, and remove the "E" prefix to the state number
	cut -f 4 MySample_ChromHMM_12_state_segmentaion.200bp.bed | sed 's|E||' > MySample_ChromHMM_12_state_segmentaion.200bp.state.txt

Required inputs are:
	- "A file", file with list of 200bp window segmented chromatin states. For this study the A file contain the healthy samples.
	- "B file", file with list of 200bp window segmented chromatin states. For this study the B file contain the malignant samples.

USAGE
	- perl compare_chromatin_200.pl [A file (text list of files)] [B file (text list of files)]

NOTES
	- example A and B files of ones used for the study are provided: compare_chromatin_200.A.WT.list, compare_chromatin_200.B.MT.list
